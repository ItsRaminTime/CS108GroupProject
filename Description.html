I will first list some random design decisions, then I will go page-by-page and 
list out all the features.

1) FIRST, make sure you are using the database schema called quiz_site.sql. It
is in the same directory as this file.

2) You can always login with the username and password both being "admin". It
gives you access to a default admin account. Whenever we detect that there is no
user in the database named "admin", we create a new one, so there is always an 
admin.

3) If you are not logged in, you will be directed to the login screen. You can
only access the login screen and the create user screen when you are not logged.
This is to prevent non-members from snooping around the site.

4) You navigate around the site by the navbar.

Now I will go page-by-page:

1) Hompage Contains:
- Announcements list
- Popular Quizzes List - links to quizzes
- Recently Created Quizzes List - links to quizzes
- Your Recently Created Quizzes List - links to quizzes
- Your Recently Taken Quizzes List - links to quiz result page
- Achievements - displays images
- Messages - links to sender's account, so you can see the profile of who sent
- Challenges - challenge messages link to quizzes, so you can "accept challenge"
- Friend Requests - must accept friend requests before finalized
- Friends - you can click on your friends to see their accounts

2) Admin Portal
- Only accessible if you are an admin
- You can post announcements that will be seen by everyone on their home pages
- you can give and take admin rights from users
- you can delete users
    - when a user is deleted, all of there messages, pending friend requests,
      outgoing challenges, outgoing messages are deleted
    - also, any quizzes they created will not display a creator any more
    - quiz results are delted and no longer displayed
    - they are also removed from friends lists
    -
- Deleting quizzes can also be done. You can either wipe out all the results for
  a quiz, or complete wipe any trace of it (including outgoing challenges) 

3) User Page
- If you are looking at someone else's page, you can send them messages or
  friend requests (note you cannot send multiple requests until the person has
  accepted)
- If you click on it in the navbar, it shows your profile, but it can also
  display other peoples profiles
- Your Recently Created Quizzes List - links to quizzes
- Your Recently Taken Quizzes List - links to quiz result page
- Your top quiz score list, links to the quiz scores
- achievements
- friends

4) Achievements
- We added achievements and little icons. They are the default ones mentioned
  in the handout

5) Quiz Library
- Displays all the quizzes sorted by both date and popularity (number of times
  taken)

6) Individual Quiz Page
- You can take the quiz
- You can take it in practice mode, meaning no data is saved
- It shows top scores and recent scores (links to the result pages for these scores)
- also you
